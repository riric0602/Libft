# LIBFT : *Your Very First Own Library*
> This project is coded in C, its purpose is to code my own library where I will have to re-implement a few functions from the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that are to be useful during my whole cursus as a 42 Nice student.

Libft was a great start for me at the Common Core, it helped me understand clearly how some fundamental functions of C work, and how important it is to know how to manipulate memory, whether by using strings, lists, structures, or pointers. It was very fun to customize and improve the C functions, but it was also crucial to learn how to protect code from leaks and segmentation faults, properly allocate memory and discover the various things the C functions actually do.

It's also a great initiation to the 42 education system where each student has to adapt and search for knowledge and answers by themselves. Realizing how detailed and a must-have the Man page is was also eye-opening.
